# Project Setup Instructions

Hi! Here is the source code for the **Swift Basket** E-commerce platform.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since we removed the heavy dependency folders to make this file easy to send, you need to install them first.

### 1. Backend Setup
1.  Open a terminal in the `backend` folder.
2.  Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
3.  Create a `.env` file (or ask for the one provided separately) with your keys (MongoDB, JWT).
4.  Run `npm run server` to start the backend.

### 2. Frontend Setup
1.  Open a terminal in the `frontend` folder.
2.  Run `npm install` to download dependencies.
3.  Run `npm run dev` to start the React app.
4.  Run `npx playwright test` to run the test suite.

Happy Coding!
